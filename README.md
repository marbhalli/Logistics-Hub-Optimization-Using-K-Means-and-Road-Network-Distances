# Logistics-Hub-Optimization-Using-K-Means-and-Road-Network-Distances
This code takes as input data points and clusters them using k-mean and p-median model based on on ground road network distances. In our case, we optimized tha placements of three logistics hubs using past delivery data. The road network of lahore can be provided on email. QGIS is required for this code to work.
